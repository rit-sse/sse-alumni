## Windows

### With Docker on Windows

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>

If you haven't already installed Docker before, you can skip step 1.

1. Uninstall Docker. On Windows Start Menu Search, search “uninstall” and click the first option. Scroll until you find “Docker for Windows” and uninstall it.
2. In Windows Start Menu Search, search “windows features” and click the first option. Scroll down until you See “Hyper-V” and uncheck it. It may already be unchecked. (More help: http://www.poweronplatforms.com/enable-disable-hyper-v-windows-10-8/)
3. Reboot Machine
4. Download Docker Toolbox for Windows  available here https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox
5. Once fully installed, go to Windows Search, type “Docker” and click Docker Terminal QuickStart. Let it do it’s thing and after installed, you will have a command prompt.
6. Use it as you normally would. cd to our project, run `docker-compose up` and it should build and be good to go!
7. The server should be running. Open Kitematic (search for it). If prompted, click "use VirtualBox". You should see sse-member on the left side. Click it, then click ports. You should see numbers like 169.168.x.x:5000 (it will be different). Copy that to your brower and you should see our page! You should actually see a 404, which is good! Append /members to the end and you will see our alumni home page!

If you make any changes to a python file, you will need to restart the docker container. Go the terminal
window and click CTRL-C, then run the command again


If you make a change to a css or js file, you do not need to restart the server. Simply
refresh the page and you will see you changes.

## To Run tests
In docker-compose.yml set `FLASK_CONFIG=testing`, then run docker-compose up --build
To revert back to running the server, set `FLASK_CONFIG=none`
